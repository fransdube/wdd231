            <h2>Our History and Values</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, the Trailblazers Hiking Club began as a small group of friends who shared a passion for
                hiking. Over the years, we've grown into a thriving community of over 500 members. Our mission is to
                promote hiking as a way to connect with nature, improve physical and mental health, and foster a sense
                of adventure.</p>
            <p>We value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> Building a supportive and inclusive environment for all hikers.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Protecting and preserving the natural spaces we explore.</li>
                <li><strong>Adventure:</strong> Encouraging members to step out of their comfort zones and try new
                    trails.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hiking is more than just a physical activityâ€”it's a way to improve your overall well-being. Here are some
                of the benefits you can enjoy as a member of our club:</p>
            <div class="benefits-grid">
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Physical Health</h3>
                    <p>Hiking is a great way to stay active and improve your cardiovascular health. It strengthens your
                        muscles, improves balance, and helps maintain a healthy weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Mental Well-Being</h3>
                    <p>Spending time in nature reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. Hiking allows you to disconnect
                        from daily pressures and reconnect with yourself.</p>

                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Connection to Nature</h3>
                    <p>Hiking immerses you in the beauty of the natural world. It's an opportunity to appreciate
                        wildlife, breathe fresh air, and enjoy stunning landscapes.</p>
